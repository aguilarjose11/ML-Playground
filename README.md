Welcome to my playground!
=========================

this repo is really a place for me to experiment with machine learning and deep learning as I self-teach!
If you are curious, I am currently working on Hands-On Machine Learning with scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow 2nd ed.
I use jupyter notebooks for my IDE.

Additionally, I am keeping code of the most used algorithms of machine learning. See [ml-by-scratch](./ml-by-scratch)

Libraries Used:
---------------

* Jupyter
* Numpy
